# Interview Problem 
Create a console application that would print the list of all the students taught by all the professors when it is run 
If any data in the database changes, the console application should detect that and print the affected professors and their list of students only. For example - If a student moves out of a course and joins some other course, two professors list of students will get affected and the application should print their updated list of students only. Similarly, if a new students joins the college and enrols for certain number of courses, the application should print once again the affected professors and their new list of students
it's possible that professors may not have any students  enrolled in their courses and we need to see the changes happening in course enrollments
